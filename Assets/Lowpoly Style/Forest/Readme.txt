Thank you very much for your purchase. We hope you enjoy the asset!

To get exactly the same look as in the screenshots on the asset store page, please use the included Forest-PostProcessingProfile included in this pack and put it into Unitys new Post Processing Stack (Available for Free from the Asset Store: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/83912)

The reason for this is the following: due to version incompatibilities, I am not allowed to include image effects or standard assets in my upload.

For the particle effects, the same applies - they are from Unitys standard assets. If you want the waterfalls exactly like in my scene, download this prefab here and put it into your scene: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_IQZLuiO-M9LWl5ZmE4eGZ6cnc

If you need help, just contact us on our publisher mail.
